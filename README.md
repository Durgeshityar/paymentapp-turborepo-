# paymentapp-turborepo- ðŸš€

This project showcases a full-fledged payment application designed
for both merchants and users, similar to Paytm. Users can enjoy a
suite of features including sending and receiving money with ease,
topping up their accounts directly from their bank (through a
simulated webhook server integration), and even facilitating on-ramp
transactions for seamless integration with various payment gateways.
Built with a powerful tech stack that prioritizes security and user
experience (Turborepo, Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, TypeScript,
NextAuth, Tailwind CSS), this application offers a robust and
user-friendly platform for managing finances.
